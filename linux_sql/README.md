# Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent
## Introduction
The Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team manages a Linux cluster of 10 nodes/servers which are running CentOS 7. These servers are internally connected through a switch and able to communicate through internal IPv4 addresses. The LCA team needs to record the hardware specifications of each node and monitor node resource usages (e.g. CPU/Memory) in realtime. The collected data should be stored in an RDBMS database. LCA team will use the data to generate some reports for future resource planning purposes (e.g. add/remove servers). This project aims to develop a MVP to help the LCA team collect/store hardware specifications and monitor server resource usage.

## Architecture and Design

## Database & Tables
The database in use is "host_agent" which has two tables, named, "host_info" and "host_usage". PostgreSQL instance is used to collect and store all requried data.

- `host_info`: This table is used to store the required hardware specifications.
  - `id`: Unique id number corresponding to each node, is a primary key in the table and is auto-incremented by PostgreSQL.
  - `hostname`: Unique constraint field for hostname.
  - `cpu_number`: Number of existing CPU cores.
  - `cpu_architecture`: CPU architecture using `lscpu`.
  - `cpu_model`: Name of CPU model.
  - `cpu_mhz`: Clock speed of the processor.
  - `l2_cache`: L2 cache size measure typically in kB. Convert to human readable form.
  - `total_mem`: Total memory in current node/server.
  - `timestamp`: The UTC timestamp of data collection.

- `host_usage`: This table holds node/server resource usage data.

  - `timestamp`: The UTC timestamp of data collection.
  - `host_id`: The id of the current server/node. This is the foreign key of the table.
  - `cpu_number`: Number of existing CPU cores.
  - `memory_free`: This is the idle memory size.
  - `cpu_idle`: The percentage of time in which the CPU remains idle.
  - `cpu_kernel`: The percentage of time in which the CPU is running.
  - `L2_cache`: L2 cache size memory typically measured in kB. Convert to human readable form.
  - `disk_io`: Current input/output operations.
  - `disk_available`: Available disk space. 


## Script Descriptions
- `host_info.sh`: Extracts required hardware specifications and inserts it into database.
- `host_usage.sh`: Extracts current host resource usage and inserts it into the database.
- `psql_docker.sh`: Start/stop docker PostgreSQL container. Start docker if necessary.
- `psql_ddl.sql`: Automates the creating of `host_agent` database and the `host_info` and`host_usage` tables when necessary.
- `queries.sql`: Contains the following 2 SQL queries to help user track the cluster.
  - Group nodes/servers by "cpu_number" and "total_mem".
  - Find average memory used over a 5 minute interval.

## Usage
- **Database and Table Initialization**: Start the docker instance. The docker instance "psql_docker.sh" will be used to start/stop instance.
```Bash
#Povision and start postgreSQL instance with docker
/.linux_sql/scripts/psql_docker.sh start db_password

#Initialize the database and tables
psql -h localhost -U postgres -W -f sql/ddl.sql
```

- **host_info.sh**: Insert `host_info` data into `host_info` table.
```Bash
./linux_sql/scripts/host_info.sh psql_host psql_port db_name psql_user psql_password
```

- **host_usage.sh**: Insert `host_usage` data into `host_usage` tale.
```Bash
./linux_sql/scripts/host_usage.sh psql_host psql_port db_name psql_user psql_password
```

- **crontab setup**: Setting crontab job to extract `host_usage` data to update as required.
```Bash
#edit crontab jobs
bash> crontab -e

#add this to crontab
* * * * * bash /home/centos/dev/jrvs/bootcamp/linux_sql/host_agent/scripts/host_usage.sh localhost 5432 host_agent postgres password > /tmp/host_usage.log

#list crontab jobs
crontab -l
```
## Improvements

- The assumption made in the current scenario is static hardware specification. This could be improvised with a script to handle dynamic hardware specifications.
- `host_usage` data can grow huge and cause memory depletion. Unnecessary data can be filtered.
